# About:

- Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- The app displays weather information based on `location` typed into search bar.
- The app will display `weather type`, `temperature`, `city name`, `daily high`, `daily low`, `humidity` and `wind speed`.

# How To Use:

- Type any `city name` within the search bar and click the `search icon` next to the search bar.
- If you've entered an invalid/incorrect `city name`, the app will display an error message and no data will appear on the screen.
- There is no default city selected on this application, so when it is opened there will be no data displayed until a `city name` is entered and searched for.

# API integration:

- The app has an API integration with `OpenWeatherMap` to collect current weather data.
